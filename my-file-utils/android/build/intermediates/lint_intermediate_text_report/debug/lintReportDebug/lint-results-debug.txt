D:\PS-v2\my-file-utils\android\src\main\java\com\example\myfileutils\MyFileUtilsPlugin.java:81: Warning: Implicitly using the default locale is a common source of bugs: Use toLowerCase(Locale) instead. For strings meant to be internal use Locale.ROOT, otherwise Locale.getDefault(). [DefaultLocale]
        switch (mimeType.toLowerCase()) {
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DefaultLocale":
   Calling String#toLowerCase() or #toUpperCase() without specifying an
   explicit locale is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that
   those methods will use the current locale on the user's device, and even
   though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app,
   it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the
   uppercase replacement for i is not I.

   If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to
   convert an enum name, call String#toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT) instead. If you
   really want to use the current locale, call
   String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault()) instead.

D:\PS-v2\my-file-utils\android\build.gradle:9: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more
   recent than your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with,
   various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application
   continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the
   targetSdkVersion is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the
   UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
